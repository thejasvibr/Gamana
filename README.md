### Gamana

'Gamana' (ಗಮನ) is the Kannada word for 'attention'. Often while recording animals with cameras and microphones, we have separate recording
systems that need to be explicitly combined. For instance, a thermal camera and an ultrasonic microphone. This provides two independent
recordings of the animals behaviour that need to be understood together for the full picture. 

This repo is called Gamana because it helps draw attention to what happens when separate audio and video streams are visualised together.
